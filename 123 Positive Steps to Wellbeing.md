# Positive Steps to Wellbeing
### Be kind to yourself
Our culture, genes, religion, upbringing, education, gender, sexuality, beliefs, and life experiences make us who we are. We all have bad days. Be kind to yourself. Encourage rather than criticize yourself. Treat yourself the way you would treat a friend in the same situation.

### Exercise regularly
Being active helps lift our mood, reduces stress and anxiety, improves physical health, and gives us more energy. Get outside, preferably in a green space or near water. Find an activity you enjoy doing, and just do it.

### Take up a hobby and/or learn a new skill
Increase your confidence and interest, meet others, or prepare for finding work.

### Have some fun and/or be creative
Having fun or being creative helps us feel better and increases our confidence. Enjoy yourself!

### Help others
Get involved with a community project, charity work, or simply help out someone you know. As well as benefiting others, you'll be doing something worthwhile which will help you feel better about yourself.

### Relax
Make time for yourself. Allow yourself to chill out and relax. Find something that suits you – different things work for different people. Breathe... (imagine a balloon in your belly, inflating and deflating as you breathe in and out)

### Eat healthily
Eat regularly, eat breakfast, eat healthily, eat fruit and vegetables, drink water.

### Balance Sleep
Get into a healthy sleep routine – including going to bed and getting up at the same time each day.

### Connect with others
Stay in touch with family and friends - make regular and frequent contact with them.

### Beware drink and drugs
Avoid using alcohol (or non-prescribed drugs) to help you cope – it will only add to your problems.

### See the bigger picture
We all give different meanings to situations and see things from our point of view. Broaden out your perspective and consider the bigger picture ('the helicopter view') What meaning am I giving this? Is this fact or opinion? How would others see it? Is there another way of looking at this? How important is it, or will it be in a year's time? What can I do right now that will help most?

### Accepting: 'It is as it is'
We tend to fight against distressing thoughts and feelings, but we can learn to just notice them and give up that struggle. Some situations we just can't change. We can surf those waves rather than try to stop them. Allow those thoughts and sensations just to be – they will pass.
