# Cognitive Distortions
### Introduction
Cognitive Therapy believes that our thoughts have a large influence on our emotions. Cognitive distortions are thoughts that affect everyone, but in their extreme form, they can negatively affect the way we interact and view our experiences. Cognitive Distortions or negative thinking can begin to happen automatically where we don't even realize that it's happening. Below you will find some of the most common cognitive distortions listed by David Burns in Feeling Good.

### ALL-OR-NOTHING THINKING
You see things in black and white categories. If your performance falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.

### OVERGENERALIZATION
You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.

### MENTAL FILTER
You pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively so that your vision of all reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that discolors the entire beaker of water.

### DISQUALIFYING THE POSITIVE
You reject positive experiences by insisting they "don't count" for some reason or other. In this way you can maintain a negative belief that is contradicted by your everyday experiences.

### JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS
You make a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts that convincingly support your conclusions.

Mind Reading. You arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you, and you don't bother to check this out.
The Fortune Teller Error. You anticipate that things will turn out badly, and you feel convinced that your prediction is an already established fact.
MAGNIFICATION OR MINIMIZATION
You exaggerate the importance of things (such as your goof-up or someone else's achievement). Or you inappropriately shrink things until they appear tiny (your own desirable qualities or the other fellow's imperfections).

This is also called the "binocular trick."

### EMOTIONAL REASONING
You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: "I feel it, therefore it must be true."

### SHOULD STATEMENTS
You try to motivate yourself with shoulds and shouldn'ts, as if you had to be whipped and punished before you could be expected to do anything. "Musts" and "oughts" are also offenders.

The emotional consequence is guilt. When you direct should statements toward others, you feel anger, frustration, and resentment.

### LABELING AND MISLABELING
This is an extreme form of over-generalization. Instead of describing your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: "I'm a loser." When someone else's behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a negative label to him: "He's a damn louse."

Mislabeling involves describing an event with language that is highly colored and emotionally loaded.

### PERSONALIZATION
You see yourself as the cause of some negative event which in fact you were not primarily responsible for.

* Describe a situation where you used one or more of the Cognitive Distortions from above. Does the automatic thought fit the facts? 
* Now, describe a more positive alternative thought that you can use next time.
