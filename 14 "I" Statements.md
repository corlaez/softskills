# "I" Statements
Taking responsibility for your feelings will help you improve your communication when you feel upset or angry. One way to achieve this is by using "I" statements. This technique will allow you to communicate what is upsetting while minimizing blaming. If our statements feel too blaming, the person we are trying to speak to will often become defensive.

**"I" Statement format: "I feel ________ when you ________ because ________."**

### Examples

Regular:	"You make me angry because you are always late"

"I" Statement:	"I feel frustrated when you come home late because I stay awake worrying."


Regular:	"You never call. You don't even care."

"I" Statement:	"I feel hurt when you forget to call because it seems like you don't care."
