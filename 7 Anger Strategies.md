# Anger Strategies
### Introduction
Anger can be a healthy and useful expression of emotion that is a natural response to unmet needs. Anger becomes a problem when it is expressed with aggression, is felt too frequently, or is not expressed appropriately.

Many times, we were taught that anger may have been the only way to get our needs met and we formed a habit of getting angry. Ask your counselor more about communication styles and, specifically, how being assertive can help.

* In the past week, what are some general events or situations that have triggered your anger? Make sure you note any patterns you notice. 
* What are some ways that you, or people around you, notice when you start to feel angry? These can by physical, behavioral, or emotional. Examples: heart starts racing, feel hot, clench fists or teeth, raise voice, stare, feel fear or disrespect, etc. 
* Think about times when you experienced anger. What were the outcomes? Note some positive and negative consequences. 
* Now that you're thinking about triggers, cues, and consequences -- let's talk about making a plan for when you start feeling some of those physical, behavioral, or emotional cues. Think about some of the positive coping skills you have discussed with your counselor. Write down a plan that includes ways you can prevent anger and also ways to immediately manage it when you start noticing cues.
