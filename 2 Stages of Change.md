# Stages of Change
### 1. Precontemplation
"Why should I change? I don't have a problem" 
At this stage, people are not seriously considering changing their behavior or have not yet recognized any need to change. They may have tried to change in the past, but are not presently interested in changing.

### 2. Contemplation
"Maybe I do I have a problem... sometimes it works for me, sometimes it doesn't"
At this stage, people are thinking and talking about change, but not sure if they want to take any steps towards making change. Many times, people will seek out support from people close to them.

### 3. Preparation
"I recognize that change is needed. How do I get there?"
This stage is for those that are ready and planning what it would take to make change happen. Many people, will seek out support and resources during this time to help.

### 4. Action
"I'm making small changes that are leading me to my goal"
Here, you are making positive steps towards reaching your goal by putting all of your preparation into change.

### 5. Maintenance
"This feels nice. I've made changes in my life for the better."
This stage is all about using the skills and behaviors you've learned to maintain the change you've made. You may still face challenges, but you have changed old habits for some period of time.

### 6. Relapse
"I fell back into an old pattern."
Falling back into old patterns is NORMAL. At this stage, there is new insight and knowledge to prevent relapse in the future.
