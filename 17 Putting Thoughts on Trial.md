# Putting Thoughts on Trial

In this exercise, you will put a thought on trial by acting as a defense attorney, prosecutor, and judge, to determine the accuracy of the thought.

#### Prosecution and Defense:
Gather evidence in support of, and against, your thought. Evidence can only be used if it's a verifiable fact. No interpretations, guesses, or opinions!

#### Judge:
Come to a verdict regarding your thought. Is the thought accurate and fair? Are there other thoughts that could explain the facts?
