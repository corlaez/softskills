* **Think of an experience that put you in a bad mood this week. Where were you? What were you doing?**

* **What different emotions did you feel? Rate the intensity of each emotion on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 as weak and 10 as strong.**

* **Describe your "automatic" thoughts. What thoughts did you have during or right after the experience? Ex: I'm such a loser for failing this test! I'm never going to graduate.**

* **Describe any evidence that supports the automatic thoughts.**

* **Describe any evidence that does not support the automatic thoughts.**

* **Using the evidence, think of an alternative explanation that may be less negative. How accurate do you think this explanation might be? Use a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 as false and 10 as true.** 

* **How do you feel about the situation after using the alternative explanation, on a scale of 1 to 10?**
