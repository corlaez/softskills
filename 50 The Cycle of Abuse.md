# The Cycle of Abuse

## Tension Builds
Stress begins to grow from the pressures of daily life, or other points of conflict. The victim may attempt to reduce tension by complying with the abuser.

## Abusive Incident
Verbal, emotional, physical, or sexual abuse occurs. This includes anger, intimidation, threats, and other forms of abuse.

## Honeymoon Phase
The abuser apologizes, shows remorse, and often begs for forgiveness. They may shower the victim with love and affection, and promise that the abuse will never happen again.

## Calm
The relationship enters a period of calm where the abuse stops or slows. The abuser may continue to ask for forgiveness, or make positive gestures, but these tend to reduce in sincerity over time.
