#Â Challenging Negative Thoughts

Depression, poor self-esteem, and anxiety are often the result of irrational negative thoughts. Someone who regularly receives positive feedback at work might feel that they are horrible at their job because of one criticism. Their irrational thought about job performance will dictate how they feel about themselves. Challenging irrational thoughts can help us change them.

Answer the following questions to assess your thought:

### Is there substantial evidence for my thought? 
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
### Is there evidence contrary to my thought? 
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
### Am I attempting to interpret this situation without all the evidence? 
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
### What would a friend think about this situation? 
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
### If I look at the situation positively, how is it different? 
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
### Will this matter a year from now? How about five years from now?
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
